# Safe Navigation Robotics Project

This project aims to create an algorithm to allow safe, autonomous
navigation for a single robot in an unknown environment.

### Running the simulator

To run the simulator, first `cd` into the directory you cloned this
repository to, then run:

```
python3 Main.py
```

There are many settings that can be configured from the command line. To
see which flags are available, just run:

```
python3 Main.py --help
```
